# Discord Bot

<h3>What is this application?</h3>

This is a Discord Bot, that has generalized code that is used to interact with gamers in a Discord Server environment.

## Motive
Primary objective was to gain foundational skills writing in .py and creating a simplistic back-end console bot to assist users in their discord community. This served as a good opportunity for me to practice and enhance my knowledge in learning another important language.
